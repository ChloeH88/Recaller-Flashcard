## Recaller Flashcard Learning Platform

### 🎗I. Intro
A platform that helps users to memorize. 
Users can create **packages** to categorize contents they want to memorize:
- Each package can contain multiple cards.
- Each card contains a **term** and **definition**.

There are two modes for memorizing:
1. **Learning Mode**: going over all cards in a package, with both term and definition shown
2. **Reviewing Mode**: showing only term. Users can choose "remember wrongly", "remember correctly", and "show definition".
